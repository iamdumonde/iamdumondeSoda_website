- Customizable Content: Enables users to modify the drink name, description, theme color, and WebP sequences through an admin interface, all of this used as the tool for customizing the webapp.
- Loading Experience: Displays a loading screen with a progress bar while pre-loading the WebP sequence to avoid flickering and ensure a smooth initial experience.

- Navigation & Sections: Features a sticky top navigation bar with smooth scrolling to different sections (Product, Ingredients, Nutrition, etc.) and highlights the active section during scroll.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: White (#FFFFFF) for text to ensure excellent readability and contrast on dark backgrounds, fitting for a cinematic feel, plus its natural partnership with black as specified in the user's request.
- Background color: Charcoal grey (#333333) provides a cinematic, modern, and slightly contrasted look without being fully black, as is optimal for OLED screens, fulfilling the 'dark and cinematic' appearance.
- Accent color: Light gray (#E0E0E0) highlights interactive elements on the darker background. 
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif font for a clean, modern, and readable design.
- Use minimalist and monochrome social media icons in the footer, for a clean overall look.
- The hero section should maintain a visually clear central area, ensuring the WebP animation remains the focal point without being obscured by UI elements.
- Apply subtle fade-out and fade-in animations when updating text during drink variant changes to ensure a smooth and visually appealing transition.
